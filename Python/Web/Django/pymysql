Pymysql - An alternative MySQL DB API driver which is not listed in Django documentation. 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/databases/

Background : 
  - Python 2.7.5. Cannot install Python3 in deploying server (CENTOS)
  - Django version 1.11 (Supported Django version for Python27 is up to 1.11. Django v2 is not supported for Python27)
  - Database : MySQL 
  
Official documentation of Django listed some MySQL DB API drivers: 
  - MySQLdb is a native driver that has been developed and supported for over a decade by Andy Dustman.
  - mysqlclient is a fork of MySQLdb which notably supports Python 3 and can be used as a drop-in replacement for MySQLdb. At the time of this writing, this is the recommended choice for using MySQL with Django.
  - MySQL Connector/Python is a pure Python driver from Oracle that does not require the MySQL client library or any Python modules outside the standard library.
  

I tried to install one of these three modules in Centos environnement but no success. 
Eventually I found an alternative Python module which is listed in offical documentation but is completely fonctional and easier to install.

Pymysql - https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/#description

Most public APIs are compatible with mysqlclient and MySQLdb.

In order to use pymysql in Django, add these lines in wsgi.py or manage.py file :


import pymysql
pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
