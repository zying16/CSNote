Immutable data types : int, float, complex, bool, string, tuple

  var1 = 'abc'
  var2 = var1
  var1 is var2 == True

  var1 += 'def'
  var1 is var2 == False

With immutable objects, since a new object is created in order to update a value, then each name will be pointing to a different object


Mutable objects : list, dictionary, set

  var1 = [0, 1, 2]
  var2 = var1

  var2 is var1 == True

  var1 += [3, 4]
  print(var2) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Update the value of var1 and the value of var2 also changed. This happens only with mutable types.
